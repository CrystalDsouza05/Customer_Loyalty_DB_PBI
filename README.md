## üìå Problem Statement

I built this Power BI dashboard for the **Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty Analytics Challenge.**

As a data analyst at OmniRetail, I analyzed 2024 customer feedback to understand what drives satisfaction, support engagement, and repeat purchases.
The dashboard uncovers key patterns across regions, income levels, age groups, and loyalty tiers to support better retention strategies.

## üìê DAX Measures & Calculated Columns

### üîπ **Key Measures**

```dax
Total Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Data[Customer_ID])

Avg Score = AVERAGE(Data[Satisfaction_Score])

Female % =
DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT(Data[Customer_ID]), Data[Gender] = "Female"), [Total Customers])

Male % =
DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT(Data[Customer_ID]), Data[Gender] = "Male"), [Total Customers])

Repeat_Customer_Percent =
DIVIDE(CALCULATE([Total Customers], Data[Purchase_History] = "Yes"), [Total Customers])

Support_Contacted_Percent =
DIVIDE(CALCULATE([Total Customers], Data[Support_Contacted] = "Yes"), [Total Customers])

At_Risk_Count =
CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Data), Data[Is_At_Risk] = "Yes")

At_Risk_Percent =
DIVIDE(CALCULATE([Total Customers], Data[Is_At_Risk] = "Yes"), [Total Customers])

Silent_Loyal =
CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Data), FILTER(Data, Data[Loyalty_Level] = "High" && Data[Satisfaction_Score] < 5))

High_Loyalty_Percent =
DIVIDE(CALCULATE(SUM(Data[Satisfaction_Score]), Data[Loyalty_Level] = "High"), CALCULATE(SUM(Data[Satisfaction_Score])))

Medium_Loyalty_Percent =
DIVIDE(CALCULATE(SUM(Data[Satisfaction_Score]), Data[Loyalty_Level] = "Medium"), CALCULATE(SUM(Data[Satisfaction_Score])))

Low_Loyalty_Percent =
DIVIDE(CALCULATE(SUM(Data[Satisfaction_Score]), Data[Loyalty_Level] = "Low"), CALCULATE(SUM(Data[Satisfaction_Score])))
```

---

### üî∏ **Calculated Columns**

```dax
Customer_Segment = Data[Age_Group] & "-" & Data[Loyalty_Level]

Is_At_Risk =
IF(Data[Satisfaction_Score] < 4 && Data[Support_Contacted] = "No", "Yes", "No")
```
